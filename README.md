jpostal
-------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openvenues/jpostal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openvenues/jpostal)

These are the Java/JNI bindings to [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal), a fast, multilingual NLP library (written in C) for parsing/normalizing physical addresses around the world.

Usage
-----

To expand address strings into normalized forms suitable for geocoder queries:

```java
import com.mapzen.jpostal.AddressExpander;

// Singleton, libpostal setup is done in the constructor
AddressExpander e = AddressExpander.getInstance();
String[] expansions = e.expandAddress("Quatre vingt douze Ave des Champs-Élysées");
```

To parse addresses into components:

```java
import com.mapzen.jpostal.AddressParser;

// Singleton, parser setup is done in the constructor
AddressParser p = AddressParser.getInstance();
ParsedComponent[] components = p.parseAddress("The Book Club 100-106 Leonard St, Shoreditch, London, Greater London, EC2A 4RH, United Kingdom");

for (ParsedComponent c : components) {
    System.out.printf("%s: %s\n", c.getLabel(), c.getValue());
}
```

To use a libpostal installation with a datadir known at setup-time:

```java

import com.mapzen.jpostal.AddressParser;
import com.mapzen.jpostal.AddressExpander;

AddressExpander e = AddressExpander.getInstanceDataDir("/some/path");
AddressParser p = AddressParser.getInstanceDataDir("/some/path");
```

Building libpostal
------------------

Before building the Java bindings, you must install the libpostal C library. Make sure you have the following prerequisites:

**On Ubuntu/Debian**
```
sudo apt-get install curl autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```

**On CentOS/RHEL**
```
sudo yum install curl autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig
```

**On Mac OSX**
```
brew install curl autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```

**Installing libpostal**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal
cd libpostal
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --datadir=[...some dir with a few GB of space...]

make
sudo make install

# On Linux it's probably a good idea to run
sudo ldconfig
```

Note: libpostal >= v0.3.3 is required to use this binding.


Building jpostal
----------------

Only one command is needed:

```
./gradlew assemble
```

This will leverage gradle's NativeLibrarySpec support to build for the JNI/C portion of the library and installs the resulting shared libraries in the expected location for java.library.path

Usage in a Java project
-----------------------

The JNI portion of jpostal builds shared object files (.so on Linux, .jniLib on Mac) that need to be on java.library.path. 
After running ```gradle assemble``` the .so/.jniLib files can be found under ```./libs/jpostal/shared``` in the build dir. For running the tests, we set java.library.path explicitly [here](https://github.com/Qualytics/jpostal/blob/master/build.gradle#L63).


Compatibility
-------------

-  Building jpostal is known to work on Linux and Mac OSX (including Mac silicon).
-  Requires JDK 16 or later. Make sure JAVA_HOME points to JDK 16+. 


Tests
-----

To run the tests:

```
./gradlew check
```
